This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications:  unhandled client-side errors. The `about.js` page intentionally throws an error.  The solution demonstrates how to implement proper error boundaries to catch and handle these errors gracefully, preventing the application from crashing and providing a better user experience.
